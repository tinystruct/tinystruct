[![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=tinystruct/tinystruct&type=Date)](https://www.star-history.com/#tinystruct/tinystruct&Date)

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher
- Maven (for dependency management)
- A text editor or IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code, etc.)

Installation and Getting Started
--
* Add the dependency into your pom.xml.
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.tinystruct</groupId>
  <artifactId>tinystruct</artifactId>
  <version>1.7.4</version>
  <classifier>jar-with-dependencies</classifier> <!-- Optional -->
</dependency>
```

* Extend the AbstractApplication in Java:

```java
package tinystruct.examples;


import org.tinystruct.AbstractApplication;
import org.tinystruct.ApplicationException;
import org.tinystruct.system.annotation.Action;

public class example extends AbstractApplication {

    @Override
    public void init() {
        // TODO Auto-generated method stub
    }

    @Override
    public String version() {
        return "1.0";
    }

    @Action("praise")
    public String praise() {
        return "Praise the Lord!";
    }

    @Action("say")
    public String say() throws ApplicationException {
        if (null != getContext().getAttribute("--words"))
            return getContext().getAttribute("--words").toString();

        throw new ApplicationException("Could not find the parameter <i>words</i>.");
    }

    @Action("say")
    public String say(String words) {
        return words;
    }

}

Handling over **86,000** requests per second with low average latency (~17.44ms), indicating the endpoint is highly efficient under heavy load. this shows the raw power and efficiency of the **tinystruct framework**. But it's not just about the performance numbers. It's about the **philosophy** behind it.

### What makes tinystruct framework modern?

1. **No `main()` method required**
   Applications can be started directly using CLI commands like `bin/dispatcher`, with no boilerplate code needed. This removes unnecessary ceremony from the development lifecycle.

2. **Unified design for CLI and Web**
   Unlike Spring Boot which is primarily web-centric, **tinystruct** treats CLI and Web as equal citizens. This makes it perfect for AI tasks, script automation, and hybrid applications — all from the same codebase.

3. **Built-in lightweight HTTP server**
   Whether it’s Netty or Tomcat, tinystruct integrates the server lifecycle inside the framework. There's no need for separate containers or complicated configuration files. Just import what you need and run.

4. **Minimal configuration philosophy**
   Configuration is minimized to the essentials. You don't need to wire up hundreds of beans, and there's no excessive XML or YAML involved. This improves developer productivity and reduces bugs.

5. **Annotation-based routing**
   The framework provides a clean and intuitive routing mechanism using `@Action`, eliminating the need for overly complex controller hierarchies.

6. **Performance-first architecture**
   There’s almost zero overhead. No reflection-based bean scanning, no auto-wiring maze, no unnecessary interceptors unless explicitly enabled. This translates into faster response times and smaller memory footprint.

7. **Developer empowerment without complexity**
   With tinystruct, developers are free to focus on **real business logic** rather than fighting with framework mechanics. It's designed to be **transparent**, **predictable**, and **extensible** — all without sacrificing control or performance.
